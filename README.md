# Markum

Markum is the minimalist Markdown editor, built around an efficient student workflow. It has all the features I need, and none of those I don't:

- Vim mode for 10x editing speed
- Autosaving so that I never need to press save
- Live preview rendered and beautified with Tailwind Typography
- Autocompletion, syntax highlighting and other bread-and-butter text editor features
- Best part: it's so fast, and the executable footprint is tiny!

```bash
